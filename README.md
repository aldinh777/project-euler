# Projekt Euler

My solutions of the programming challenge from the site [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) with 9 different programming language :

* Golang
* Haskell
* Java
* Javascript
* Php
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust

## How to

make sure required compiler or interpreter is ready.
by default, it will assume you have nodejs installed

run :

`node test/index.js`

it will run test configuration from `test_config.json`. if it didn't exists yet, it will be copied from `_default_config.json`
