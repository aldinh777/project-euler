- Clojure
- Go
- Haskell
- Typescript
- Julia
- Kotlin
- Lua
- OCaml

## How to

make sure required compiler or interpreter is ready.
by default, it will assume you have bun installed

run :

`bun p`

it will run test configuration from `_config.json`. if it didn't exists yet, it will be copied from `_default_config.json`
